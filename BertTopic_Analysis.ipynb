        "  This category is mainly about biocheminal scientific researches due to the high frequent words in this topic the words Patinet, model result [250 to 300 times] were most repetitive ones alongside other descriptive words like treatment, cancer, clinical, infection. Recrding to top 10 important sentences in this topic we infer that the content of texts are mostly models and methods about human chemical activities [amino acid, proteomic findings, synaptic activity] related to mortality and  human body imunology and more generally about heath care [WHO, food, organic].\n",

        " As listed in diagram of 25 most frequent words and most important sentences in this class of texts, contents are mainly about neural networks methods and technologies related to cure human body issues. Since the words like TENS,  knee arthrosis, encoding of deep neural networks, heart sound classification, adaptive image-feature learning for disease classification and tterance-level Permutation Invariant Training (uPIT) technique which is a technique for minimizing mean square error were detected as significant pharases in this topic.\n",

        "\n",
        " In generall, this group is all about startegies and analysis in markrting and trading. Because the words like market, price, optimal, strategy, process, analysis, information theory, agent and prediction appear among most 25-th frequent words. More effective subjects in this category that can explain our deduction about this topic description sentences like: seasonal and trend forecasting of tourist arrivals,  most common pricing rules, cryptocurrency price prediction, trading and trend forecasting of tourist arrivals ."
